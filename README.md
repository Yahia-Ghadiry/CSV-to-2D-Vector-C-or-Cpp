# CSV-to-2D-Vector-C-or-Cpp
function to read csv data into a 2d materx for easy manuplation  

I have used some of the code from this blog : https://www.techiedelight.com/split-string-cpp-using-delimiter/ 
and some from stack overflow

Ok I think I am done but wanted to put example maybe next week
I am not a professional so ther is probably many inefficiencies in my code

don't foreget to add these in your code :

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>


using std::cout, std::vector, std::string, std::ifstream;
